## Ask a Question

We will have a public forum soon where you can come and ask questions and have a discussion. For now please open an Issue on GitHub with the label `question`.


## Requesting a new component

If your team requires a new component that is not listed on the [Design System Documentation](https://design.rockcontent.com/docs/getting-started/), please follow the necessary steps in order to request a new component:

1. [Create a new issue](https://github.com/rockcontent/rock-ui/issues/new/choose) by selecting the `Component Request` type.
1. Add the tag `component request` on the issue;
1. Add a description explaining why this component is necessary and the name of the product that need it;
1. Add a Figma link, screenshot or an example of an existing component;
1. Add spacing, colors, how it should work and any other important description that we need to know to create this component;
1. Once you created the issue, send a message on **#team-design-system-community** Slack Channel with the link to the issue.

*Note*: Issues that do not have all the requirements won't be accepted.

## Getting Started

Follow our [README](https://github.com/rockcontent/rock-ui/blob/master/README.md) to get the Rock UI up and running.

We will have soon ([help wanted](https://github.com/rockcontent/rock-ui/issues/2)) a live project page and storybook to make it easier to check our UI Kit.

Note: if youâ€™d like to implement a new feature, please consider creating a feature request issue first to start a discussion about the feature.

## Style Guides

### Git Style Guide

* Keep a clean, concise and meaningful git commit history on your branch, rebasing locally and squashing before submitting a PR
* Follow the guidelines of writing a good commit message as described here https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/ and summarised in the next few points
    * In the subject line, use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
    * In the subject line, use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
    * Limit the subject line to 72 characters or less
    * Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the subject line
    * Add more detailed description in the body of the git message (`git commit -a` to give you more space and time in your text editor to write a good message instead of `git commit -am`)
